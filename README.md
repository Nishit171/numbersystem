# In the given project, it consists of 3 files README , index.js and app.js
# in the index.js file the code is written to find even or odd number from given array. 
# if the array is [1,2,3,4] then the output should be
# Odd 1
# Even 2
# Odd 3
# Even 4

# in the next file app.js in consists of 3 main code
# firs code is to find all prime numbers from the given array and store  them into a new array called primeArray
# so if the given array is [1,2,7,8,11]
# then the out arrayy should me 
# primeArray = [2,7,11]

# Next part of the code loops through the array and find the maximum and minimun number from the array
# output for the above primeArray should be
# Maximum : 11
# minimum : 2

# now the last part of the code sum the whole primeArray so the output shoudl be 2+7+11 which is 
# 19
